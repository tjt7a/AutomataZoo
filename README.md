# AutomataZoo Automata Processing Benchmark Suite

AutomataZoo is an automata processing benchmark suite and is an improved version of [ANMLZoo](https://github.com/jackwadden/ANMLZoo).

If you have any questions or comments, please contact tjt7a@virginia.edu or create an Issue Ticket.

## Description

High performance automata-processing engines are traditionally evaluated against a limited set of regular expression rulesets. These serve as valid, real-World example use cases, but they only represent a small proportion of all automata-based applications. With the recent availability of architectures and software frameworks for automata processing, many new applications have been discovered that benefit from automata processing. These demonstrate a broad variety of characteristics that differ from prior regular expression-based applications, and warrant their own benchmarks.

## Improvements over ANMLZoo

AutomataZoo improves upon ANMLZoo in several ways:

- The suite of benchmarks is not standardized to a particular architecture, and does not inherit the same architectural biases as ANMLZoo.

- The benchmarks implement full kernels, which allows for comparisons between automata and non-automata approaches.

- The suite includes open-source tools for generating benchmark automata and inputs of various sizes, allowing for design space explorations.


## Benchmarks

1. **Snort:** A widely used network intrusion detection system.
2. **ClamAV:** A virus-detection tool that relies on a publicly-available database of malware patterns.
3. **Protomata:** An automata-based application that searches for a set of 1309 protein motif patterns from the PROSITE database.
4. **Brill Tagging:** A rule-based approach to part-of-speech tagging.
5. **Random Forest:** A machine learning model based on ensembles of decision trees.
6. **Hamming Distance:** A string-scoring kernel that accepts inputs that are within a set hamming distance of a configured pattern.
7. **Levenshtein Distance:** A string scoring kernel that accepts inputs that are whtin a set edit distance of a configured pattern.
8. **Sequence Matching:** An automata application that counts sorted sequences of item sets to identify frequently-occurring sets.
9. **Entity Resolution:** An automata application that attempts to find duplicate entries in a streaming database.
10. **CRISPR/Cas9:** An automata application that enabled gene editing by identifying targeted locations.
11. **YARA:** An automata application that discovers malware described in the YARA malware pattern description language.
12. **File Carving:** An automata application that identifies files in a stream of input bytes.
13. **Pseudo Random Number Generation (PRNG):** An automata application that models Markov Chains with finite automata to generate high-throughput PRNG streams.
